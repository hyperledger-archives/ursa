# Run demo

- The Go demo requires the Ursa shared library to be installed (eg: /usr/local/lib), and the header file `include/ursa_cl.h`
to be installed in your C include path (eg: /usr/local/include).  You can run sample code from the Ursa go wrapper using command:
```
go run cmd/demo/demo.go
```

# Requirements
- Golang >= `1.14.4` and CGO enabled.
