# Lab Name
crypto-lib

# Short Description
A lab for experimentation on creating shared cryptography modules for cross-project collaboration

# Scope of Lab
The purpose of this lab is to serve as an initial launching point for what will hopefully become a shared Hyperledger cryptography library.  We aim to use this lab to set up a code base and experiment with integrating cryptographic protocols between projects.

See:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JtFT5L-82egj6shgGXzTsNAg6_UHuMheKfsst6NS_Xo/edit?usp=sharing

## Before you Continue

If you haven't done so already, please visit the main resource for all things "Indy" to get acquainted with the code base, helpful resources, and up-to-date information: [Hyperledger Wiki-Indy](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/indy/Hyperledger+Indy).

# Crypto Lib

This is the shared crypto library for [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects) components.

[Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects) provides a distributed-ledger-based foundation for [self-sovereign identity](https://sovrin.org).

The major artifacts of the Crypto Lib are:
* С-callable library interface
* Rust сrate

All bugs, stories, and backlog for this project are managed through [Hyperledger's Jira](https://jira.hyperledger.org)
in project IS (note that regular Indy tickets are in the INDY project instead...). Also, join
us on [Jira's Rocket.Chat](chat.hyperledger.org) at #indy-sdk to discuss.

## Building Crypto-Lib

1. Install xcode command line tools
```
xcode-select --install
```
1. Install Rust and rustup (https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html).
1. Install Libsodium
    - For Mac OS X
```
brew install libsodium

or to build it from scratch

brew install autoconf
brew install automake
git clone git@github.com:jedisct1/libsodium.git
cd libsodium
./autoconf
./configure
make
sudo make install
```
1. Checkout and build the library:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/crypto-lib.git
   cd ./crypto-lib/libhl-crypto
   cargo build
   cd ..
   ```
1. Run tests
   ```
   cd libhl-crypto
   cargo test
   ```
**Note:**
By default `cargo build` produce debug artifacts with a large amount of run-time checks.
It's good for development, but this build can be in 100+ times slower for some math calculation.
If you would like to analyse CPU performance of libindy-crypto for your use case, you have to use release artifacts (`cargo build --release`).

### Windows build dependency
System OpenSSL library is required.
- Download the prebuilt dependencies [here](https://repo.sovrin.org/windows/libindy_crypto/deps/)
- Extract them into the folder _C:\BIN\x64_
> It really doesn't matter where you put these as long as you remember where so you can set
> the environment variables to this path
- Point path to this directory using environment variables:
  - set INDY_CRYPTO_PREBUILT_DEPS_DIR=C:\BIN\x64
  - set OPENSSL_DIR=C:\BIN\x64

## Documentation
Project documentation is available via sphinx.
Install sphinx:
```
pip install -U Sphinx
```
Build the project docs:
```
cd docs/
make html
```

API documentation is now available as rust doc in code. See:
* C API
    - [BLS](./src/ffi/bls.rs)
    - [CL](./src/ffi/cl/)
* Rust API
    - [BLS](./src/bls/mod.rs)
    - [CL](./src/cl)

## Binaries

Note: Binaries creation is in progress now!!!

Builded binaries can be downloaded from https://repo.sovrin.org:
* sdk/lib/apt/xenial/{master,stable,rc} - Ubuntu deb packages
* windows/libindy_crypto/{master,stable,rc} - Windows zip-archive with all required DLLs (include libindy itself) and headers
* ios/libindy_crypto/stable/ - Pods for iOS
* rhel/libindy_crypto/{master,stable,rc} - RHEL rpms

Also Ubuntu deb packages can be installed from APT repository:
```
apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 68DB5E88
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://repo.sovrin.org/sdk/deb xenial stable"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libindy-crypto
```
